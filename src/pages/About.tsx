                    Hi, I'm <strong className="text-primary">Tate Downs</strong>, and this is the story of how TTM Painting came to life.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Since March 2025, I worked for a large corporate painting company where I learned the ins and outs of professional painting. During that time, I had the opportunity to hire two incredible friends who would become my business partners: <strong className="text-primary">Troylee Mager</strong> and <strong className="text-primary">Matthew Buckley</strong>.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Together, we spent that summer doing what we love most - transforming homes in our community. Every project was an opportunity to prove ourselves, and we consistently delivered exceptional results that exceeded our clients' expectations. The satisfaction of seeing a homeowner's face light up when they saw their newly painted home was what drove us every single day.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    By July 2025, we realized we had something special. The trust we'd built with our clients, the quality of our work, and the passion we shared for the craft made it clear that it was time to take the leap. That's when we decided to go out on our own and start TTM Painting.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    We may be new to running our own business, and yes, we're young - but that's exactly what makes us different. We're hungry to prove ourselves, we're not set in old ways, and we bring fresh energy and modern techniques to every project. Our youth means we're willing to go the extra mile, stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies, and treat every job like it's the most important one we've ever done.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    At TTM Painting, we're not just painting walls - we're building relationships, creating beautiful spaces, and proving that high-quality work comes from passion, dedication, and a genuine care for our community.
