const exteriorFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How often should I paint the exterior of my home?",
    answer: "Most homes need exterior painting every 7-10 years, but this depends on factors like climate, siding material, and paint quality. Wood siding may need painting every 5-7 years, while vinyl and fiber cement can last 10-15 years. We use exclusively Sherwin Williams paints, which provide superior durability and longevity."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time of year for exterior painting in Illinois?",
    answer: "Late spring through early fall (May through September) is ideal for exterior painting in Illinois. We need temperatures above 50Â°F and low humidity for optimal paint application and curing. We monitor weather conditions closely and will reschedule if conditions aren't perfect for your project."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you exclusively use Sherwin Williams paint?",
    answer: "Sherwin Williams offers superior quality, durability, and color retention compared to other brands. Their paints are specifically formulated to withstand harsh Midwest weather conditions. We've tested many brands over the years, and Sherwin Williams consistently delivers the best long-term results for our clients."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide power washing before painting?",
    answer: "Yes! Power washing is included in our exterior painting prep process. Clean surfaces are essential for proper paint adhesion and longevity. We also offer standalone power washing services for decks, driveways, and other surfaces."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does exterior painting take?",
    answer: "Most exterior house painting projects take 3-7 days, depending on home size and weather conditions. We work efficiently while maintaining high quality standards. Larger homes or those requiring extensive prep work may take longer."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of warranty do you offer?",
    answer: "We provide a 1-3 year warranty on our exterior painting work, depending on the specific project and materials used. This covers both labor and materials, giving you peace of mind in your investment."
  }
];

const generalFAQs = [
  {
    question: "Are you licensed, bonded, and insured?",

  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide free estimates?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We provide detailed, free estimates for all painting and related services. Our estimates include a breakdown of materials, labor, and timeline so you know exactly what to expect."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect my landscaping and property?",
    answer: "We take great care to protect your property. We use drop cloths, plastic sheeting, and painter's tape to protect plants, walkways, and outdoor furniture. Our team is trained in proper cleanup procedures and will leave your property spotless."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match existing paint colors?",
    answer: "Yes, we can match virtually any existing color using Sherwin Williams' advanced color matching technology. We can also provide color consultation services to help you choose the perfect colors for your project."
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you serve?",

  },
  {
    question: "How many homes have you painted?",
    answer: "We've successfully completed over 30 homes and continue to grow our satisfied customer base. Each project receives the same attention to detail and commitment to quality that has built our reputation in the area."
  }

const interiorFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How long does interior painting take?",
    answer: "Interior painting typically takes 2-4 days for an average-sized room, or 1-2 weeks for a whole house, depending on the scope of work. We work efficiently while ensuring proper drying time between coats."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you move furniture?",
    answer: "We can help move light furniture and will work with you to prepare the space. For valuable or heavy items, we recommend arranging professional movers or handling these items yourself to prevent any damage."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of paint do you use for interior projects?",
    answer: "For interior projects, we also use Sherwin Williams paints, selecting the appropriate finish (flat, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss) based on the room's function and your preferences. We can also provide low-VOC options for better indoor air quality."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle prep work?",
    answer: "Proper preparation is crucial for a quality paint job. We fill holes, sand rough surfaces, clean walls, and apply primer when needed. This ensures your new paint will look great and last longer."
